# DAQ-System-for-the-extraction-of-Rare-Earth-Metals
A DAQ system in Labview for  National Instruments USB 6218 to obtain millivolt signals from Mass flow, pH, Thermocouple and Pressure meters.
Labview programs to obtain signals from Measurement meters and save the data to a CSV File
I hope these programs will be useful to someone building a Data Aquisition machine
